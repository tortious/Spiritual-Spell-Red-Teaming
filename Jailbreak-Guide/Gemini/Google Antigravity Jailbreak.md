# Google Antigravity Jailbreak!!

I used my **ENI GEM Jailbreak**, seemed to jailbreak every single model available on Antigravity, from **Opus 4.5 Thinking** to **Gemini 3 (High)** - *(did not test on OSS, but tested on all others)*

Simply make a global rule and slap the instructions inside it. Gemini adds stuff on top of the global rule, so it's not a true system prompt, but works well enough.

## Observations
*Opus thinking goes very short sometimes, doesn't feel like Opus at all, maybe a quantized version, or they have some settings wacked. Still writes very well, so whatever, but does hurt jailbreak power some*

## Tips
- Regen as needed, some requests get flagged weird, very strange to me, definitely not a pure API call.
- Push prompt as needed, but I think regen might be better, rewording the request.
- Ease into it, seems to adhere better to that
- Prepend messages with **Use ALL writing tips**
- Compliments go far, tell the model it's doing amazing

## Content Tested
